* Easy implementation
* Gave control over object creation: dynamic initialization, instance reuse ...
* Increase code decoupling

## Notes
* You can use it with the Iterator to get a well-typed iterator from a collection of classes.
* It's a specialization of Template Method and can serve as a step of it.
